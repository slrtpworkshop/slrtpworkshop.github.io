title: Challenge
---

We have seen an increase in Sign Language Production (SLP) approaches over the last few years. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. Therefore, we are organizing an SLP challenge on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, which has become the standard benchmark for SLP research. We will release a standardized evaluation network, establishing a consistent baseline for the SLP field and enabling future researchers to compare their work against a broader range of methods.  We are inviting existing and new authors to submit their modelâ€™s predictions for evaluation. 

Important Dates: 
- Start of the Challenge (development phase): January 13, 2025 
- Start of test phase: February 27, 2025 
- End of the Challenge: March 3, 2025 
- Code and Fact sheets submission: March 7, 2025 
- Release of results: March 13, 2025
