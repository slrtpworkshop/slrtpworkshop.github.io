**Accessibility and Interpretation**

Our workshop will be hybrid, with both in-person and remote participation options, but the poster session will take place in person only. The workshop languages are American Sign Language (ASL), International Sign (IS), and English. ASL/English interpretation will be provided on-site, while IS/English interpretation will be provided remotely.

We sincerely thank CVPR for providing interpretation services and supporting accessibility at our workshop.
