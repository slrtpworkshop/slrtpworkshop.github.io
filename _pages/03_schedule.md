**Accessibility and Interpretation**

Our workshop will be hybrid, with both in-person and remote participation options. Workshop languages are American Sign Language (ASL), International Sign (IS), and English.

ASL/English interpretation will be provided on-site for the whole workshop. IS/English interpretation will be provided remotely for stage presentations. If you would like IS/English interpreting for the poster session as well, please contact us at [o.mercanoglusincan@surrey.ac.uk](mailto:o.mercanoglusincan@surrey.ac.uk) by April 4, 2025.

We sincerely thank CVPR for providing interpretation services and supporting accessibility at our workshop.
